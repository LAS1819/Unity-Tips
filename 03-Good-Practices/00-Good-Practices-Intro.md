# Good Practices in Software Development

## Introduction

Good practices are set of guidelines, principles, and mehgodologies that help developers write **clean, maintanable, and efficient code**. They are not sctrict rules but proven solutions to common problems, born from decades of collective experience in the industry.

### Why Use Good Practices?

- **Maintainability**: code is easier to understand, modify, and debug.
- **Scalability**: systems can grow without becoming unmanageable.
- **Collaboration**: teams work more efficiently with consistent standards.
- **Bug Prevention**: many practices help avoid common pitfalls.
- **Performance**: optimized patterns lead to better resource usage.

## Core Principles

Here are the foundational topics covered in this section:

### 1. ðŸ§± [SOLID Principles](01-SOLID-Principles/01-SOLID-Introduction.md)

- Five object-oriented design principles to create flexible and robust architectures.

### 2. ðŸ”„ [DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)](02-DRY-Principle.md)

- Avoid code duplication to reduce maintenance overhead.

## Real-World Analogy

Think of good practices like **traffic rules**:

- **SOLID** -> Lane discipline (each class has a clear "lane").
- **DRY** -> Carpooling (avoid redundant "trips" in code).

## FAQ

### Q: Are good practices language-specific?

A: No! While examples may use C#/Unity, the concepts apply to most languages.

### Q: What if my project is small?

A: Even small projects benefit. Technical debt grows exponentially-better to prevent it early.

### Q: How strict should I be?

A: Balance is key. Adapt practices to your team's needs, but avoid cutting corners.
